			<h2>Fun brainstorm session about "Users' Git Helper", a potential new porcelain</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			In a not so serious Skype conversation, the issue of Git's usability came
			up. Once again. It is a sad thing that still, the user interface design of
			Git has nothing in common with the straight-forward, beautiful and simple
			design of the data structures beneath.
			</p><p>
			It is still quite common for me to suggest using Subversion to other people
			because it is easier to use.
			</p><p>
			So the idea was to have a new "porcelain" for Git, which would try much,
			much harder to be intuitive than all the other porcelains which try to fix
			the user interface warts of the Git command line interface.
			</p><p>
			In other words, the idea is that there is no way you can fix the command-line
			interface, for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the inertia of
			a precious few power-users, which according to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGIntro/XHIGIntro.html">Apple's Human Interface Guidelines</a> is not a good thing:
			<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGDesignProcess/XHIGDesignProcess.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002718-TPXREF136">"If you try to design for the 20 percent of your target audience who are power users, your design may not be usable by the other 80 percent of users."</a>. Just as an example, what does splitting a mailbox into individual mails have to do with Version Control? Exactly.
			</p><p>
			Guiding principle would be the 80 percent solution, or analogously:
			</p><p>
			<ul>
			<li> Optimize for the common case.
			<li> Make the simple easy and the difficult possible.
			<li> Before the green button, the Xerox machine was unusable.
			</ul>
			</p><p>
			So many different ways to describe the same thing &#x263a;
			</p><p>
			But enough of the philosophical talk. Let's look at some possible interface design. First things first, the name. Users' Git Helper:

			The 'undo' command must be intelligent about what makes sense and what not.
			For example, once published, the commit should not be undoable, except on

			how to set this conveniently.
			</p><p>
			Inside a repository, "ugh get" would try to pull the tracked branch if it
			fast-forwards (but it would not say the word "fast-forward"; I had to explain
			the meaning of that term one hundred billion times; one hundred billion times
			too many, if you ask me), but fetch in any case and error out with the message
			that there are local commits in addition to remote ones, so a merge is
			necessary:

			Since people are familiar with other commands, "ugh <command> --help" would be

			<h4>Footnotes</h4>
			</p><p>
			<a name="foot-1" /><a href="#ref-1">1</a>: In the olden days, there were no
			repositories to get from somewhere, so it is obvious why the initial user
			interface design did not make that easy. Now, you might think that a "git clone"
			is not too bad, but why all these differences between "clone", "fetch", "pull"?
			Exactly, because the technical details -- the very same users could not care
			less about -- are different.

			<h2>New msysGit imminent</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			Sebastian Schuberth worked so much on msysGit, and he wants a new release. That is the reason why there will be a new msysGit version very soon.
			</p>
			<h6>Monday, 8th of February, Anno Domini MMX, at the hour of the Goat</h6>
			<a name=1265634257>
			<h2>Trying to get more time for msysGit</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			Nowadays, the msysGit project is driven forward mostly by Heiko Voigt,
			Erik Faye-Lund, and of course the invaluable mingw.git work of Hannes
			Sixt. The new-SVN, MinGW-SVN and MinGW-Python projects have stalled.
			The latest msysGit release is <u>months</u> old.
			</p><p>
			It does not help that certain people on the Git mailing list write
			looooong emails that nobody with my schedule can hope to read, rather
			than being nice and spending some time to phrase what they have to
			say in a <u>concise</u> manner.
			</p><p>
			Oh well. I will just concentrate on JGit and msysGit instead of
			upstream Git, if I get some Git time.

			<h2>Avoiding to get angry</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			Despite many intelligent people realizing that the recent
			change to special case http, https and ftp was a terrible decision, it
			seems that there is enough resistance left on the Git mailing list to
			keep the brain-dead current state.
			</p><p>
			The Git mailing list is definitely giving me more grief than joy these
			days.

			<h2>Git will never be user-friendly</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			Recently, encouraged by quite some private encouragement, I thought I could
			take on the task of teaching the core Git developers how user-unfriendly
			Git is, and that they should be more open to change (especially given that
			1.7.0 was already announced to be a version that breaks recent expectations,
			something I would have expected to merit a 2.0 -- but who am I anyway?).
			</p><p>
			It is quite ironic, in a very cruel sense, that those people who are such
			big fans of educating the users instead of fixing their tools are unable
			to be educated about something that should be obvious.
			</p><p>
			Yes, I am bitter.
			</p>
			<h6>Wednesday, 7th of October, Anno Domini MMIX, at the hour of the Rat</h6>
			<a name=1254868748>
			<h2>GitTogether in Berlin</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			We had a GitTogether in Berlin, called "Alles wird Git" (past tense: "Alles
			wurde Git").  It was great fun, we never had even a single boring minute,
			and our special guest -- Gitzilla -- turned out to be quite some entertainer,
			especially when he starting reciting a few of my most outrageous emails &#x263a;
			</p><p>
			There were a lot of good discussions, among other things about submodules (our
			neglected child), Git Cheetah, and foreign VCS helpers (in particular Sverre's
			plan to provide some Mercurial backend).
			</p><p>
			One of the most important outcomes for me was, though, to realize just how
			detached we in the Git project are from our user base.  A few years back, we
			could get away with saying "we have only developers as users, so they should
			just sit down and scratch their own itch".
			</p><p>
			But today, we have a lot of users who never learnt to code (or who code in
			some other language than C, or whose code we would not even want to review &#x263a;),
			and we lose quite a few brownie points by keeping things complicated.
			</p><p>
			Now, in a lot of cases it cannot be helped.  For example, we have confusing
			names for things, inconsistent namings even (as with "remote" vs "tracked"
			branches), and we have some odd design decisions (like calling some program
			almost nobody uses "git cherry", which makes tab-completion of the rather
			often-used "git cherry-pick" pretty awkward).  The latter example also
			illustrates that we have names for porcelains that are rather long, when
			they should be rather short.
			</p><p>
			So, yes, we have a lot of things that do not work well, because we have
			usability issues that need to be preserved for hysterical raisins.
			</p><p>
			This is unfortunate enough, but it seems that we even fsck up with usability
			issues we <u>can</u> solve.  Just think about "git checkout -b origin/master".  A
			typo?  Yes, of course!  But a rather obvious one.
			</p><p>
			Another case which was discussed on the mailing list recently: "git checkout
			next" when clearly "git checkout origin/next" was meant.
			</p><p>
			The biggest problem, though, is that almost all people on the Git mailing list
			who are respected by the maintainer are obviously too detached from the user
			base to realize just how difficult Git <u>still</u> is.  And refuse to do anything
			about it, or even to allow others to do anything about it.
			</p><p>
			It almost seems as if the Git wizards do not want Git to become easier to
			use, lest they lose their special status.
			</p><p>
			My biggest problem is that it seems that my input gets more and more ignored,
			or perceived as some crazy ideas that will just go away (which is true, because
			I am pretty happy about a day-job that keeps me more than just busy, so I do not
			have time not fight windmills, let alone motiviation to do so).
			</p><p>
			Even when a real user comes along to chime in, he's just brushed off, by an
			otherwise very polite maintainer.
			</p><p>
			I am not even sure if I want to continue sending my patches from my personal
			tree upstream, because things get so frustrating, for little to show in return.

			<h2>The dilemma of being correct</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			So I am opinionated.  No news there.  The problem of being opinionated, though,
			is that people do not take you seriously even if you are correct.
			</p><p>
			For example, I vividly remember having had concerns about the Git wrapper
			being linked to <a href=http://curl.haxx.se/>cURL</a>, and I vividly remember
			that our maintainer did not have such concerns and took Daniel's patch.  I could
			not find proof of my public comment quickly enough to add a link here, though.

			Alas, there are serious problems with being correct:
			</p><p>
			<ol>
			<li>If you're correct, you waste a lot of time trying to convince people (but
			they ignore you nevertheless),
			<li>Other people are regularly p*ssed off, especially when they find out
			(or even worse, when it is pointed out to them) that they were wrong, and
			<li>You can buy <u>nothing</u> for having been correct.
			</ol>
			</p><p>
			It is a lose-lose situation.
			</p><p>
			In the current context, I am pretty certain that the rev cache and the pack
			index are so similar in nature that we'll find quite a few issues that we had
			with one repeated with the other.
			</p><p>
			As I <u>hate</u> losing time over a discussion others try to "win" -- which
			invariably means that they refuse to be convinced of anything disagreeing with
			their opinion &#x263a; -- I will just shut up, and probably have one or two odd
			feelings when it turns out I was right.

			<h2>The GraphGUI project</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			After a few unfortunate delays (and some fortunate ones, just not for us), the
			GraphGUI project finally takes off.  A quick first glance:
			</p><p>
			<center><img src=dscho.git?a=blob_plain;hb=c33212b23b2b3e45c14403efe82cabb1cd53f6e3;f=basic-gui.jpg basic-gui.jpg></center>
			</p><p>
			The delays were a bit unnerving, but the student is really bright and still
			has the chance to pull the project off.
			</p><p>
			Next plans are to show text, too, to invent a rudimentary layout engine that
			can be adjusted manually (this is in contrast to <i>gitk</i> or <i>log --graph</i>).
			</p><p>
			After that, integration into JGit (this probably triggered the eGit/JGit
			split).
			</p><p>
			And then we'll go wild!

			<h2>Wasting way too much time on msysGit</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			I recently got into the bad habit of spending a large amount of my waking
			hours working on msysGit, more than is really healthy for me.
			</p><p>
			For example, I spent the whole morning -- when I should have worked on a
			very important day-job project -- on trying to fix issue 258, where
			<i>git web--browse</i> does not work as expected because of quoting issues
			with cmd.exe.
			</p><p>
			This is reducing my Git time budget to negative numbers, so much so that I
			cannot even work on Git projects that I actually like, such as <i>jgit diff</i>
			or <i>git rebase -i -p</i>, or at least projects I felt obliged to continue
			to work on, such as <i>git notes</i>.
			</p><p>
			Now, some people who tried to teach me some time management strongly
			criticized me for ignoring their lessons, and unfortunately, I have to agree.
			</p><p>
			The problem is that I would <u>hate</u> to see msysGit fall to the same state it
			was after I stopped working on it last year.  I started it, and I would like
			it to grow, but too few people took care of the issue tracker, too few tried
			to debug their problems themselves, too few submitted fixes.
			</p><p>
			I note, though, that there is a positive trend.  But being the impatient person
			I am ("2 seconds is my attention span") I tend to want the trend to be more
			impressive.
			</p><p>
			Anyway, no work on msysGit for at least 4 days, that's what the doctor (me)
			said...

			<h2>Working on jgit diff</h2>

			<p>
			</p><p>
			Shawn did so many useful things that I use on a daily basis that I felt really
			awful when I realized just how <u>long</u> I had promised to clean up that diff
			implementation I wrote for JGit.
			</p><p>
			Alas, it appears that the thing turned out to be almost a complete rewrite, as
			the original implementation walked the edit graph in a rather inefficient way.
			</p><p>
			A little background: Myers' algorithm to generate "an edit script" works on
			the <i>edit graph</i>: imagine you have all lines of file <i>A</i> as columns and
			all lines of file <i>B</i> as rows, then the <i>edit graph</i> is a connection of
			the upper left corner to the lower right corner, containing only horizontal,
			vertical or diagonal elements, where diagonal elements are only allowed when
			the lines of both files agree at that point:
			</p><p>
<pre>
 H E L L O , W O R L D
 ----
L    \
      ---
O        \
          ---
W            \
              --------
</pre>
			</p><p>
			The <i>shortest</i> edit path minimizes the number of non-diagonal elements.
			</p><p>
			Myers' idea is to develop forward and backward paths at the same time
			(increasing the number of non-diagonal elements uniformly), storing
			only the latest end points.  Once the paths meet, divide and conquer.
			</p><p>
			In theory, it would be quicker to store <u>all</u> end points and then just
			reconstruct the shortest paths, alas, this takes way too much memory.
			</p><p>
			My first implementation did not remember start or end of the non-diagonal
			parts, and had to recurse way more often than really necessary (in the end,
			we will order the non-diagonal parts into horizontal and vertical parts
			anyway, so start and end are sufficient).
			</p><p>
			The current progress can be seen <a href=http://repo.or.cz/w/egit/dscho.git/>
